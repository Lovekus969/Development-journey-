Date: 31 May
‚úÖ Topic Covered: How Text Works in the DOM (JavaScript)
üß† What We Learned:
textContent

Returns all text, including hidden elements.

Does not consider CSS or visibility.

Fast and safe for scripting.

innerText

Returns only visible text (ignores display: none).

Considers layout and styles.

Slower (triggers reflow/repaint).
innerHTML

Returns the full HTML content (with tags).

Useful to insert/remove elements with structure.

‚ö†Ô∏è Can be a security risk if used with untrusted data.




Use textContent for raw, fast, and secure data extraction.

Use innerText only when you care about what the user actually sees.

Use innerHTML when you're injecting complex HTML, but sanitize it.

Use console.log() to log values (text, numbers, or properties).

Use console.dir() when you're debugging and need to explore the object's internals.

You can't chain .property after console.dir(), because it doesn't return the object‚Äîit just logs it.


TOday we will see some linklist data structure problem 
The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the context in which a function is executed ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way to access the object that is currently calling the function.

Understanding this is very important for FAANG interviews, especially for object-oriented JS, event handling, and React class components.
