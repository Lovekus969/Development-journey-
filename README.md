# Development-journey-
We will proceed from the  very intial phase . html to the entire journey of full stack all in one in this repo . and i will upload my entire notes up to date and in final i will upload the all of the notes and books which helps me to get out from this journey remember 

Say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù to pain, shake hands with it. This is my journey .





Date: 31 May
‚úÖ Topic Covered: How Text Works in the DOM (JavaScript)
üß† What We Learned:
textContent

Returns all text, including hidden elements.

Does not consider CSS or visibility.

Fast and safe for scripting.

innerText

Returns only visible text (ignores display: none).

Considers layout and styles.

Slower (triggers reflow/repaint).
innerHTML

Returns the full HTML content (with tags).

Useful to insert/remove elements with structure.

‚ö†Ô∏è Can be a security risk if used with untrusted data.




Use textContent for raw, fast, and secure data extraction.

Use innerText only when you care about what the user actually sees.

Use innerHTML when you're injecting complex HTML, but sanitize it.

Use console.log() to log values (text, numbers, or properties).

Use console.dir() when you're debugging and need to explore the object's internals.

You can't chain .property after console.dir(), because it doesn't return the object‚Äîit just logs it.


TOday we will see some linklist data structure problem 
The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the context in which a function is executed ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way to access the object that is currently calling the function.

Understanding this is very important for FAANG interviews, especially for object-oriented JS, event handling, and React class components.
Question ........... Both Array.prototype.toString() and Array.prototype.join() convert an array to a string in JavaScript. Why does JavaScript have both methods if they appear to do the same thing? In what scenarios would you prefer one over the other?"
JavaScript provides both toString() and join() for different levels of control and semantic clarity, even though their default behavior is similar.

üß† Similarity:
Both methods return a string representation of an array.

If no separator is passed to join(), it defaults to a comma, just like toString().

javascript
Copy
Edit
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.toString(); // "1,2,3"
arr.join();     // "1,2,3"
üîç Difference:
------------------**toString()** ----------------- is a generic method inherited from Object. prototype (redefined by Array.prototype) and is meant for quick stringification, often automatically called in string contexts.
console.log([1, 2, 3] + ""); // "1,2,3" ‚Äî toString() is called implicitly


-------------------**join()** ---------------------- is specific to arrays and allows for custom separators, making it more powerful and versatile when formatting output.
arr.join(" - "); // "1 - 2 - 3"
arr.join("");    // "123"
üöÄ When to use which:
Use Case	Method
Quick conversion, no formatting	toString()
Custom formatting or separators	join()
Implicit coercion (e.g., logging)	toString() (automatically called)
Generating formatted strings	join()

‚úÖ Bonus (FAANG Edge):
Understanding the subtle difference shows your awareness of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance and built-in method design. This helps in writing clean, readable, and performance-aware code in large systems.
| Function  | Logic Like   | Returns `true` if...        |     |                               |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | --- | ----------------------------- |
| `some()`  | `OR` (\`     |                             | \`) | **Any** one condition is true |
| `every()` | `AND` (`&&`) | **All** conditions are true |     |                               |
