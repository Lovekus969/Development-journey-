Q..What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.It’s a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.Think of it as a waiter between you (the client) and the kitchen (the server). You place an order (request), and the waiter brings back your food (response).

Types of APIs:
Web APIs: Communicate over HTTP/HTTPS, commonly used in web apps.
Library APIs: Methods you call inside code libraries.
Operating System APIs: Like Windows API for OS-level stuff.


Q.. What is an API Request?
When your app wants some data or action from another service, it sends a request.

                    Method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
                    
                    URL: Endpoint you’re requesting from.
                    
                    Headers: Extra info like auth tokens.
                    
                    Body: Data you send (for POST, PUT).


Why JSON?
            JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is lightweight, easy to read/write, and easy for machines to parse.
            
            Almost every web API uses JSON because it works perfectly with JavaScript and many other languages.

What is the Twitter API?
The Twitter API is a set of tools provided by Twitter that lets developers programmatically interact with Twitter’s platform.

It allows your app or program to read and write Twitter data — like fetching tweets, posting tweets, following users, searching trends, and more.
