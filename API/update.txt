Q..What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.Itâ€™s a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.Think of it as a waiter between you (the client) and the kitchen (the server). You place an order (request), and the waiter brings back your food (response).

Types of APIs:
Web APIs: Communicate over HTTP/HTTPS, commonly used in web apps.
Library APIs: Methods you call inside code libraries.
Operating System APIs: Like Windows API for OS-level stuff.
